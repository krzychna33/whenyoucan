# WhenYouCan - Frontend

### About

***WhenYouCan is an app to organize events and meetings (and whatever you want). It solves a
problem with choosing suitable times in group of people.***

In the app you can create your own calendar and share it to other people.
Calendars are protected by PIN. Every person in the calendar can add their own suitable times.
If some time is right for everyone (or number of people you set up when creating calendar) this
time will be highlighted. Users will also getting extra tips, which time they should choose to get event started 
as soon as possible.

Concept and whole app has been created by @krzychna33.
**App is still under development, so probably there are a lot of things to fix.**
There are a lot of ideas for upcoming features that will be introduced into the app in the future.

Things for nearest future:
* Monthly View
* User profile editor
* Introduce/improve validation on forms
* UX fixes
